            <h2>The Issue</h2>
            <p>Child labor is a sad reality that affects millions of children worldwide. It is important to understand the causes, consequences, and what can be done to eradicate this practice.</p>
            <p>According to the ILO (International Labor Organization), more than 160 million children are involved in child labor, many of them in hazardous conditions. This impairs their physical and mental development and violates their basic rights.</p>

            <h2>Stories</h2>
            <h1>Eliseu Alves</h1>
            <p>Eliseu Alves started working at seven years old, collecting trash and, at eight, selling candy on the street, which impacted his education, delaying his literacy until he was 12. Despite the challenges and traumas, such as police violence, he managed to return to school and, at 23, is proud to have helped support his younger siblings.</p>
            <h1>Marco Bastos</h1>
            <p>Marco Bastos, on the other hand, left school at 12 to work as a construction helper, maturing prematurely by living among adults. At 18, he found a better path by becoming an apprentice, but believes that no child should go through what he experienced, questioning how he could focus on school knowing he had to work afterward.</p>
